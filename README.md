## DJLES - Dubreil-Jacotin-Long Equation Solver

DJLES is a MATLAB based software package that solves the Dubreil-Jacotin-Long equation, yielding a mode-one internal solitary wave.

## Quick start

Download the code and run one of the case files in either MATLAB or Octave. The case files take less than one minute to run on a recent desktop computer, and upon completion the code will produce a plot of the wave.

## Documentation

A LaTeX user guide is included, a compiled version is available [here](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~mdunphy/djles.pdf) ([mirror](https://palang.ca/DJLES/djles.pdf)).
